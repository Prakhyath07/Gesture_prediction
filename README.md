# Gesture Prediction using Machine Learning

Natural control methods based on surface electromyography (sEMG) and pattern
recognition are promising for hand prosthetics. However, the control robustness offered
by scientific research is still not sufficient for many real life applications, and commercial
prostheses are capable of offering natural control for only a few movements. In recent
years deep learning revolutionized several fields of machine learning, including
computer vision and speech recognition.
The goal is to predict the gestures based on the data recorded by the MYO Thalmic
bracelet.
